Most voltage regulation needs can be met with simple LDOs.
Issues only arise when the input voltage and output voltage differential is too high, or too low.
Most low cost LDOs have a minimum differential between input and output voltages around 1V.
the minimum differential voltage is usually called Vdropout, and restricts choices in certain cases.
